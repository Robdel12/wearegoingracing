# F3 Race Results

Basically this page is a giant TODO for me. I want to create a scraper (using
Puppeteer) that turns the iRacing site into a JSON API. This then would allow
for us to create nice and dynamic React components which pull in race results
(along with lots of other things).

#### Playground

This is playing around with sample data from a the Friendly Slow League

<SeasonResults />
