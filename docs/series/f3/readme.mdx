## FAQ

#### How can I participate?

The very first thing to do would be to [join our iRacing
league.](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/LeagueView.do?league=3825). Once
you have done that you could join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GxueMZA),
which is what we use to communicate _outside_ of races (you could also
communicate through iRacing's league messages too).

That's it! Next thing to do is to join the race session when it's started.

#### Is this free?

Yes, 100% free! [Join our league on
iRacing](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/LeagueView.do?league=3825)
to get started. We would love to have you!

#### Will the races be recorded? 

They will be. We'll uploading each race to our [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8yqdXbezSwkM2Vxux7-mQ/). They will
be produced with iRacing video director, so don't expect anything super
professional unless you want to contribute :)

#### What's the series season schedule?

We will be running four 12 week seasons a year, which will line up with the
iRacing seasons. The first season will be a little cut short since we're
starting late. We may even through some wild week 13 things together if folks
are into it!
